Minecraft in rust. for testing and developing rendiation framework

Some new point want to try in future:

* new world generation algorithm. (realistic, some physical method maybe?)

* different terrain/block shaping by different marching cube algorithm. (shape of brick is blocky but shape of dirt/sand is smoothed)

* realistic volumetric cloud

* cities, village, artificial things generation?

* optimized for runtime rendering, lod chunk stuff?

* extendable generation system
